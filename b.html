<p>Nutrition is the science that interprets the interaction of nutrients and other substances
in food in relation to maintenance, growth, reproduction, health and disease of an organism.
It includes food intake, absorption, assimilation, biosynthesis, catabolism, and excretion.[1]
The diet of an organism is what it eats, which is largely determined by the availability and palatability of foods.
For humans, a healthy diet includes preparation of food and storage methods
that preserve nutrients from oxidation, heat or leaching, and that reduce risk of foodborne illnesses.고 할 수 있지요.</p>
